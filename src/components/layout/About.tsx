            service applications over the last couple of years and I'm extremely
            pleased with their performance, ability to execute, and willingness
            to adapt in our ever-changing environment. Perry is an outstanding
            leader who is fanatical about customer satisfaction. He has built a
            solid team which has consistently delivered on projects thereby
            exceeding everyoneâ€™s expectations.
